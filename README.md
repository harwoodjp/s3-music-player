## Refactor motivation and goals

* Reorganizing to a more general, extensible architecture. 
* Making data retrieval procedures generic, allowing multiple data sources.
* Bringing in Express for smoother routing and baked-in optimizations
* UI will be a set of React applications. Client-side routing + relocating UI logic to components will tidy the code base.
