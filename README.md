## Refactor motivation and goals

* Reorganize to a more general, extensible architecture
* Make data retrieval procedures generic to allow multiple data sources
* Bring in Express for smoother routing and baked-in optimizations
* UI will consist of (a) React application(s)
	* Client-side routing will allow us to do more without rendering new pages 
	* Relocating UI logic to components will tidy the code base significantly
